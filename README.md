Learning Saviynt has been an amazing journey! From understanding access management, roles and entitlements, RBAC & ABAC, provisioning and de-provisioning, to Segregation of Duties (SoD) analysis and mitigation, I have gained practical knowledge and confidence in working with this tool.
I also explored compliance and audit processes, user lifecycle management, and the overall Identity Governance framework. Working with Saviynt helped me connect theoretical concepts to real-world enterprise scenarios, making the learning experience highly engaging and rewarding.

Key Concepts Covered
* Identity Governance & Administration (IGA)

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

* Provisioning & De-provisioning

* Segregation of Duties (SoD) analysis

* Compliance & Audit readiness

* ISPM (Identity Security & Policy Management)
This repository is a reflection of my learning journey with Saviynt. It has been a wonderful experience, and I hope it can help others who are starting their IGA journey or exploring enterprise access management tools.
