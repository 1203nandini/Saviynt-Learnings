I was very curious to learn about Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), and I decided to dive deep into Saviynt, a leading IGA tool. Learning Saviynt has been an amazing journey. From understanding access management, roles and entitlements, RBAC & ABAC, provisioning and de-provisioning, to Segregation of Duties (SoD) analysis and mitigation, I have gained practical knowledge and confidence in working with this tool.
I also explored compliance and audit processes, user lifecycle management, and the overall Identity Governance framework. Working with Saviynt helped me connect theoretical concepts to real-world enterprise scenarios, making the learning experience highly engaging and rewarding.

Key Concepts Covered
* Identity Governance & Administration (IGA)

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

* Provisioning & De-provisioning

* Segregation of Duties (SoD) analysis

* Compliance & Audit readiness

* ISPM (Identity Security & Policy Management)
  
I am proud to have earned the Saviynt ISAA (Identity Security & Access Administrator) Certification, which validates my expertise in Saviynt IGA concepts, access management, and enterprise identity governance practices.
This repository is a reflection of my learning journey with Saviynt. It has been a wonderful experience.
